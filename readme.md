# Introduction
Quantum computing can potentially speed up certain tasks greatly, but its benefits for computational models must be better defined in early literature. This work introduces a new Quantum DNA Encoder (QDE) design that can efficiently and effectively encode genetic data. QDE uses a simple circuit model that can be used on a 4-qubit system and provides better class boundaries than One-Hot Encoding (OHE) by generalizing data encoding to a higher-dimensional embedding space. In order to showcase how well the method works, we utilize a large collection of gRNA within the CRISPR Cas-9 system. Comparing baseline representations, QDE outperforms OHE in two out of four representations with a high level of statistical significance. This study is significant in the early quantum machine intelligence literature as the translation of quantum technology to biomedical research
